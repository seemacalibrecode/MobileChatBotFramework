# MobileChatBotFramework

The mobile chatbot  framework helps you find out all possible answers that your Bot can give for various formats of questions asked 
by your users. Aritificial Intelligence or training your Bot to understand different intents requires you to first understand how 
your Bot currently behaves for various questions.

This framework can read the questions from a spreadsheet and run on a mobile emulator to test the Bot and records the answers given in an accurate manner.
